# Colors.FYI data
This repo is designed to collect data about colors that make it work with color while making sure content is accessible.

## Current color data
- A list of all named colors (definately borrowed with love)
- A list of all 292,000+ colors that work with white and black.
- A generated set of palettes that you can count on to have standardized relative lumenance

Quick note, thank you to Ariel and Gosia (links coming) for finding an orange that sparked my brain, and to the people who made [colorbox](https://www.colorbox.io/) at lyft, who also made me think "This is how we should be thinking of color".
